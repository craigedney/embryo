# Proportionals

> **Proportional:** Corresponding in size or amount to something else.

How do you produce of an explicit listing of elements?

- Finite Set
- Count of "X"

Natural numbers:
- Numbers used for counting (cardinals) and ordering (ordinals).

### Cardinality
> A number that tells us how many "items" are in a set.

**Example:**
> If there are three elements in `List`... then `List` has a cardinality of 3.

- We have a set named `"List"`.
- `List` contains the "items": `Item One`, `Item Two`, `Item Three`.

This is represented in the following structure: 

```
ExampleSet={"Item One", "Item Two", "Item Three"}
```

- We can determine that there are **_three elements_** in `List`, by counting the number of "items".
- Therefore, `List` has a **cardinality of 3**

Enumeration:
- An enumeration is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection. The term is commonly used in mathematics and computer science to refer to a listing of all of the elements of a set. The precise requirements for an enumeration (for example, whether the set must be finite, or whether the list is allowed to contain repetitions) depend on the discipline of study and the context of a given problem.

Ordered List:
- When an enumeration is used in an ordered list context, we impose some sort of ordering structure requirement on the index set. While we can make the requirements on the ordering quite lax in order to allow for great generality, the most natural and common prerequisite is that the index set be well-ordered. According to this characterization, an ordered enumeration is defined to be a surjection (an onto relationship) with a well-ordered domain. This definition is natural in the sense that a given well-ordering on the index set provides a unique way to list the next element given a partial enumeration.
