# Natural numbers
> SIMPLE DEFINITION

- Numbers used for counting (cardinals) and ordering (ordinals).

## Example
> If there are three elements in `List`... then `List` has a cardinality of 3.

- We have a set named `"List"`.
- `List` contains the "items": `Item One`, `Item Two`, `Item Three`.

This is represented in the following structure:

```
ExampleSet={"Item One", "Item Two", "Item Three"}
```

- We can determine that there are **_three elements_** in `List`, by counting the number of "items".
- Therefore, `List` has a **cardinality of 3**
